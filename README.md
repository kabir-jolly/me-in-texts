# me-in-texts

This project explores my digital footprint, attempting to better uncover who I am and what my relationships look like based on the largest digital repository of data I have on myself, my text messages.

The main question I am hoping to answer is:

Has the nature of the communication I have with my online relationships changed over the past decade (ages 12 till 22)?
Some supporting questions that come up in the event to uncover the central answer include:

Who are the top contacts I've communicated with throughout time?
Has my communication style changed over the years?
What individual and group communications drive the bulk of my online interactions?
